# TFG

This is my first relevant programming experience. 

My aim is to create a program which can solve the
transport equations of a system of superparamagnetic
nanoparticles under the influence of an external
magnetic field gradient. This involves partial
differential equations and therefore I will be
using python's FEniCS open source software to achieve
it.

First I have tried a few tests in python3 with 
matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, math and scipy before using the
FEniCS software to get familiar with the python 
programming dynamics. This was possible because the
analytical solution for the transport equations is known 
for a constant magnetophoretic velocity.

Once this solutions have been developed, I have 
been programing with the FEniCS software numerical
solutions, i.e. without the analytical solution. 

A stationary 2D advection-diffusion version of the program
is already available.
