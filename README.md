# TFG

This is my first relevant programming experience. 

My aim is to create a program which can solve the
transport equations of a system of superparamagnetic
nanoparticles under the influence of an external
magnetic field gradient. This involves partial
differential equations and therefore I will be
using python's FEniCS open source software to achieve
it.

First I have tried a few tests in python3 with 
matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, math and scipy before using the
FEniCS software to get familiar with the python 
programming dynamics.
